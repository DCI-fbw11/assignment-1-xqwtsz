                <h3>A new report shows</h2>

                In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic decline.<br><br>
                That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites,
                 a nonprofit organization that closely monitors penguins and other <span style="color:darkred">Antarctic seabirds</span>,
                  in collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in New York.<br><br>
                
                Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660 sites across the frozen continent,
                 the study paints a broad picture of the health of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap,
                  emperor, and gentoo. Like endangered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">polar bears</a>,
                   penguins have come to represent vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</a>.<br><br>
                
                The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula,
                 which has warmed by a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years. <br>
                
                There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to changing circumstances. <br><br>
