            Antarctica's penguins are in trouble...</h1>

        <h3>A new report shows</h3>
        <p>In the rapidly warming Antarctic,
        two species of penguins are in dramatic decline.</p>

        <p>That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit organization
             that closely monitors penguins and other <span style="color:red">Antarctic seabirds</span>, in collaboration
             with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in New York.</p>
        <p>Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more 
            than 660 sites across the frozen continent, the study paints a broad 
            picture of the health of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie,
            chinstrap, emperor, and gentoo. Like endangered 
            <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-plan-on-threatened-polar-bears-lacks-teeth-critics-say/">polar bears</a>, penguins
            have come to represent vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding
            <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/climate-change/">climate change</a>.</p>
            <p>
            The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by a 
            year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years. 
            <br>
            There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in severe 
            decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to changing circumstances.
